			<pre>

				I think that I shall never see	
				A poem lovely as a tree.

				A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
				Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;

				A tree that looks at God all day,
				And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

				A tree that may in summer wear
				A nest of robins in her hair;

				Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
				Who intimately lives with rain.

				Poems are made by fools like me,
				But only God can make a tree.
