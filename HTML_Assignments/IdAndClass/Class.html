	<p class="classDemo">
		In HTML, the "class" selector is used to select an element with a specific class attribute. The class selector starts 
		with a period (.) followed by a class name. Unlike the id selector, we can attach multiple selector to an HTML element. 
		Therefore, the class can be applied many time within a page. The important point to note about the class selector is 
		that the class name must not be started with a number.
